This event was designed to highlight the importance of teamwork, perseverance, and physical activity—values that are crucial in both fields. The event brought together junior high school students who participated in a series of sports tasks, including relay races, team-building challenges, and other physical activities. The idea behind these tasks was to encourage students to work together, just like in robotics, where collaboration is essential for success. We wanted to show that the same qualities—discipline, communication, and dedication—apply in both sports and robotics."

				"text": "One of the most rewarding parts of the event was connecting with university students and professors. We met many students curious about robotics and eager to get involved in similar projects. Their enthusiasm was inspiring, and we enjoyed sharing advice and encouraging them to explore STEM. Several professors provided valuable feedback on our robot, offering insights that sparked ideas for future improvements and projects. This experience reminded us of the importance of outreach and collaboration in STEM. Beyond competitions, robotics is about building a community and inspiring the next generation of innovators. Participating in SDU STEM Week left us motivated to continue growing, improving, and sharing our journey with others."
