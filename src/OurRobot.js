					<h1>OUR ROBOT</h1>
					<p>
						Our design and construction process is powered by teamwork and
						creative problem-solving. Every member contributes ideas and
						expertise, whether in mechanical design, programming, or strategy
						development. Collaboration fuels our success, enabling us to build
						innovative robots that adapt to the fast-paced nature of FTC
						competitions. As the season unfolds, we continuously test, evaluate,
						and refine our designs to achieve peak performance. Whether it's
						enhancing grip mechanisms, improving drive systems, or fine-tuning
						autonomous routines, our robot evolves along with our skills and
						experience. Ultimately, our mission is not just to build great
						robots but to foster a passion for science, technology, engineering,
						and math (STEM) while pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in
						competitive robotics.

							<h1>Advanced Tools for Precision Engineering</h1>
							<p>
								To construct our robots, we rely on high-quality components
								sourced from trusted suppliers like GoBILDA and REV Robotics.
								These companies provide industry-leading parts, such as durable
								chassis components, precision motors, gear systems, sensors, and
								more. Using these professional-grade materials ensures our
								robots perform consistently under the pressures of competitive
								play. Additionally, we incorporate custom elements such as
								3D-printed parts to tailor the robot’s capabilities to meet
								game-specific challenges.
