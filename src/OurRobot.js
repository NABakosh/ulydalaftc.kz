					<h1>OUR ROBOT</h1>
					<p>
						Our team’s approach to building competitive robots is grounded in
						innovation, precision, and adaptability. Each season presents a
						unique challenge, and we rise to meet it by designing robots that
						are not only functional but also efficient, reliable, and versatile.
						As the competition rules change every year, so does our robot’s
						design, construction, and features. This dynamic environment pushes
						us to constantly learn, improve, and refine our strategies and build
						techniques.

						<p>
							To construct our robots, we rely on high-quality components
							sourced from trusted suppliers like GoBILDA and REV Robotics.
							These companies provide industry-leading parts, such as durable
							chassis components, precision motors, gear systems, sensors, and
							more. Using these professional-grade materials ensures our robots
							perform consistently under the pressures of competitive play.
							Additionally, we incorporate custom elements such as 3D-printed
							parts to tailor the robot’s capabilities to meet game-specific
							challenges.

							Our design and construction process is powered by teamwork and
							creative problem-solving. Every member contributes ideas and
							expertise, whether in mechanical design, programming, or strategy
							development. Collaboration fuels our success, enabling us to build
							innovative robots that adapt to the fast-paced nature of FTC
							competitions. As the season unfolds, we continuously test,
							evaluate, and refine our designs to achieve peak performance.
							Whether it's enhancing grip mechanisms, improving drive systems,
							or fine-tuning autonomous routines, our robot evolves along with
							our skills and experience.
							<br /> Ultimately, our mission is not just to build great robots
							but to foster a passion for science, technology, engineering, and
							math (STEM) while pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in
							competitive robotics.
